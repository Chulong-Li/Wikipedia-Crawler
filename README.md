# Wikipedia-Crawler
Clicking on the first link in the main text of a Wikipedia article, and then repeating the process for subsequent articles, will usually lead to the Philosophy article. So I build this python code try to find a path from [**Food**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food) article to [**Philosophy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy) article.
